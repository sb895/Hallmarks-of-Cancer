Previous studies with selenium and/or vitamin E in prostate carcinogenesis animal models have been negative , but these models may not involve oxidative stress mechanisms .
In this study , we examined the potential of selenomethionine and alpha-tocopherol to modulate prostate cancer development in the testosterone plus estradiol-treated NBL rat , a model that does involve sex hormone-induced oxidative stress mechanisms and prostatic inflammation .
One week following the implantation with hormone-filled Silastic implants , rats were fed diets containing l-selenomethionine ( 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg ) , DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate ( 2,000 or 4,000 mg/kg ) , or a natural ingredient control diet ( NIH-07 ) .
The development of prostate carcinomas was not affected by dietary treatment with either agent .
Food intake , body weight , and mortality were also not affected .
The high dose of selenomethionine reduced the severity of epithelial dysplasia in the lateral prostate that was not associated with inflammation , and alpha-tocopherol reduced in a dose-related fashion the incidence of marked inflammation and marked epithelial dysplasia in the lateral prostate , regardless of whether these lesions were associated with inflammation. alpha-Tocopherol significantly increased the incidence of adenocarcinomas of the mammary glands at both dietary concentrations .
Collectively , our findings suggest that selenomethionine and alpha-tocopherol supplementation does not prevent prostate cancer in rats fed diets with nutritionally adequate levels of selenium and vitamin E. Importantly , the results of the current animal studies and those reported previously were fully predictive of the outcome of the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial .
