ATM(Tel1) and ATR(Rad3) checkpoint kinases phosphorylate the C-terminus of histone H2AX ( H2A in yeasts ) in chromatin flanking DNA damage , establishing a recruitment platform for checkpoint and repair proteins .
Phospho-H2A/X ( gammaH2A/X)-binding proteins at double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) have been characterized , but those required for replication stress responses are unknown .
Here , we present genetic , biochemical , small angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS ) , and X-ray structural studies of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Brc1 , a 6-BRCT-domain protein that is structurally related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtt107 and mammalian PTIP .
Brc1 binds gammaH2A to form spontaneous and DNA damage-induced nuclear foci .
Spontaneous Brc1 foci colocalize with ribosomal DNA repeats , a region prone to fork pausing and genomic instability , whereas DNA damage-induced Brc1 foci colocalize with DSB response factors. gammaH2A binding is critical for Brc1 function .
The 1.45 A resolution crystal structure of Brc1-gammaH2A complex shows how variable BRCT insertion loops sculpt tandem-BRCT phosphoprotein-binding pockets to facilitate unique phosphoprotein-interaction specificities , and unveils an acidic DNA-mimicking Brc1 surface .
From these results , Brc1 docking to gammaH2A emerges as a critical chromatin-specific response to replication-associated DNA damage .
