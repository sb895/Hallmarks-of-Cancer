A common metabolic change in cancer is the acquisition of glycolytic phenotypes .
Increased expression of glycolytic enzymes is considered as one contributing factor .
The role of mitochondrial defects in acquisition of glycolytic phenotypes has been postulated but remains controversial .
Here we show that functional defects in mitochondrial respiration could be induced by oncogenic H-Ras(Q61L) transformation , even though the mitochondrial contents or mass was not reduced in the transformed cells .
First , mitochondrial respiration , as measured by mitochondrial oxygen consumption , was suppressed in NIH-3T3 cells transformed with H-Ras(Q61L) .
Second , oligomycin or rotenone did not reduce the cellular ATP levels in the H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells , suggesting a diminished role of mitochondrial respiration in the cellular energy metabolism .
Third , inhibition of glycolysis with iodoacetic acid reduced ATP levels at a much faster rate in H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells than in the vector control cells .
The reduction of cellular ATP levels was reversed by exogenously added pyruvate in the vector control cells but not in H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells .
Finally when compared to the HRas(Q61L) transformed cells , the vector control cells had increased resistance toward glucose deprivation .
The increased resistance was dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation since rotenone or oligomycin abolished the increased survival of the vector control cells under glucose deprivation .
The results also suggest an inability of the H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells to reactivate mitochondrial respiration under glucose deprivation .
Taken together , the data suggest that mitochondrial respiration can be impaired during transformation of NIH-3T3 cells by oncogeneic H-Ras(Q61L) .
