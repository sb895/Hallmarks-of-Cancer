γ-Tocotrienol and sesamin are phytochemicals that display potent anticancer activity .
Since sesamin inhibits the metabolic degradation of tocotrienols , studies were conducted to determine if combined treatment with sesamin potentiates the antiproliferative effects of γ-tocotrienol on neoplastic mouse ( +SA ) and human ( MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 ) mammary cancer cells .
Results showed that treatment with γ-tocotrienol or sesamin alone induced a significant dose-responsive growth inhibition , whereas combination treatment with these agents synergistically inhibited the growth of +SA , MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 mammary cancer cells , while similar treatment doses were found to have little or no effect on normal ( mouse CL-S1 and human MCF-10A ) mammary epithelial cell growth or viability .
However , sesamin synergistic enhancement of γ-tocotrienol-induced anticancer effects was not found to be mediated from a reduction in γ-tocotrienol metabolism .
Rather , combined treatment with subeffective doses of γ-tocotrienol and sesamin was found to induce G1 cell cycle arrest , and a corresponding decrease in cyclin D1 , CDK2 , CDK4 , CDK6 , phospho-Rb , and E2F1 levels , and increase in p27 and p16 levels .
Additional studies showed that the antiproliferative effect of combination treatment did not initiate apoptosis or result in a decrease in mammary cancer cell viability .
Taken together , these findings indicate that the synergistic antiproliferative action of combined γ-tocotrienol and sesamin treatment in mouse and human mammary cancer cells is cytostatic , not cytotoxic , and results from G1 cell cycle arrest .
