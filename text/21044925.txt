BACKGROUND AND AIMS breast reconstruction with silicone prosthesis following nipple-sparing mastectomy has become widely accepted as a reconstruction option in women requiring mastectomy for cancer .
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and some factors influencing early local complications in patients undergoing NSM with immediate implant reconstruction .
MATERIAL AND METHODS prospective study was performed on a consecutive series of 214 breast reconstructions in 205 patients .
All complications during the six weeks after surgery were recorded. 42 prostheses were implanted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy , 27 patients previously had radiotherapy due to breast conserving surgery and in all other cases surgery was the pri-mary treatment for cancer .
RESULTS the overall six-week complication rate was 16% ( 35 ) and included : major skin flap necrosis ( 4% , 9 procedures ) , minor skin necrosis ( 3% , 7 ) , major infection ( 2% , 5 ) , minor infection ( 3% , 7 ) , prolonged seroma formation ( 3% , 6 ) , haematoma ( 1% , 2 ) and epidermolysis ( 1% , 2 ) .
In 6% ( 12 ) reconstruction procedures explantation of prosthesis was done .
Neoadjuvant chemo-therapy and radiotherapy were not associated with higher rate of complications .
CONCLUSION nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction has acceptable morbidity rate in the hand of experienced oncoplastic surgeon and therefore should be considered as treatment option to women requiring mastectomy .
