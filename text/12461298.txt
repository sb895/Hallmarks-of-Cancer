During mitotic exit , a small GTPase Tem1 needs to be activated .
During most of the cell cycle , Tem1 activity is antagonized by a GTPase activating complex ( GAP ) composed of Bub2 and Bfa1 .
Bfa1 protein has cell cycle regulated phosphorylation depending upon the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 .
This phosphorylation dissociates Bfa1 from Tem1 and thus relieves the inhibition of Tem1 by the GAP complex .
Bub2 and Bfa1 are also required to prevent mitotic exit when there is DNA damage , spindle damage or spindle misorientation at G(2)/M phase .
While Cdc5 inhibits Bfa1/Bub2 , mutating the Cdc5 phosphorylation sites on Bfa1 does not have a strong activating effect on Bub2/Bfa1 , suggesting there must be additional regulation in this pathway .
Here we report that Bub2 protein also has cell cycle regulated phosphorylation .
This phosphorylation is partially dependent upon the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 and is consistent with negative regulation of the Bub2/Bfa1 GAP complex .
Spindle damage or spindle misorientation prevents Bub2 phosphorylation .
The spindle damage effect is dependent upon the spindle assembly checkpoint components Mad2 and Mps1 .
Thus like Bfa1 , Bub2 protein is also controlled both during mitotic exit and in response to cell cycle checkpoints .
Bub2 phosphorylation is likely to be controlled by a novel kinase .
