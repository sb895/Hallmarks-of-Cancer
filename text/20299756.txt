Ovarian smooth muscle tumors are a very rare type of ovarian tumor .
In this paper , we report the case of a 62-year-old woman who had a huge smooth muscle tumor of the right ovary .
The values of all the serum tumor markers were within normal limit .
The tumor measured 25 cm in diameter and weighed 6,200 g .
Histological examination revealed that coagulative cellular atypia was moderate to severe , necrosis was not present and mitotic index was low .
According to the criteria for the evaluation of the uterine smooth muscle tumors , this huge tumor was diagnosed as atypical leiomyoma .
However , we finally made a diagnosis of this tumor as a smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential ( STUMP ) because of its huge size .
Further information is required regarding the characteristics of ovarian smooth muscle tumor and the propriety to introduce uterine tumor histological criteria to ovarian tumors .
