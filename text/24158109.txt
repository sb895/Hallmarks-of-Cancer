BACKGROUND Anti-angiogenic treatment of glioblastoma characteristically results in therapy resistance and tumor progression via diffuse infiltration .
Monitoring tumor progression in these patients is thwarted because therapy results in tumor invisibility in contrast-enhanced ( CE ) MRI .
To address this problem , we examined whether tumor progression could be monitored by metabolic mapping using ( 1)H MR spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) .
METHODS We treated groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice carrying different orthotopic diffuse-infiltrative glioblastoma xenografts with bevacizumab ( anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] antibody , n = 13 ) , cabozantinib ( combined VEGF receptor 2/c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor , n = 11 ) , or placebo ( n = 15 ) and compared CE-MRI with MRS-derived metabolic maps before , during , and after treatment .
Metabolic maps and CE-MRIs were subsequently correlated to histology and immunohistochemistry .
RESULTS In vivo imaging of choline/n-acetyl aspartate ratios via multivoxel MRS is better able to evaluate response to therapy than CE-MRI .
Lactate imaging revealed that diffuse infiltrative areas in glioblastoma xenografts did not present with excessive glycolysis .
In contrast , glycolysis was observed in hypoxic areas in angiogenesis-dependent compact regions of glioma only , especially after anti-angiogenic treatment .
CONCLUSION Our data present MRSI as a powerful and feasible approach that is superior to CE-MRI and may provide handles for optimizing treatment of glioma .
Furthermore , we show that glycolysis is more prominent in hypoxic areas than in areas of diffuse infiltrative growth .
The Warburg hypothesis of persisting glycolysis in tumors under normoxic conditions may thus not be valid for diffuse glioma .
