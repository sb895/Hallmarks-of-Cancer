Breast cancer includes high number of molecular entities targetable by specific agents .
In this study , array CGH and PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations were used to drive patients into targeted therapy .
A prospective molecular analysis was offered to metastatic breast cancer patients for whom samples were collected prospectively or retrospectively either from frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue .
Analyses were performed using array CGH ( Agilent platform ) and PIK3CA ( exon 10 and 21 ) and AKT1 mutations were explored by standard Sanger sequencing .
One hundred and eight patients were included .
Good quality CGH was obtained in 79% cases and was better for frozen samples .
Genomic alterations were identified in 50% of patients including 11 PIK3CA and 8 AKT1 mutations .
Eighteen treatments ( 17 patients ) were administered according to their molecular profile with evidence of activity in nine .
Reasons for not providing a genomic-driven treatment included absence of progressive disease ( 38% ) , investigator's choice ( 9% ) , rapid PD ( 19% ) , and no drug access ( 21% ) .
Array CGH correctly identified Her2 status in 97% cases ; failures were related to low % of tumour cells .
Our study showed that array CGH is feasible in the context of daily practice and , in combination with PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations , identifies a significant number of actionable molecular alterations that allow driving patients into specific targeted agents .
