High resolution oligonucleotide array Comparative Genome Hybridization technology ( array-CGH ) has greatly assisted the recognition of the 1p36 contiguous gene deletion syndrome .
The 1p36 deletion syndrome is considered to be one of the most common subtelomeric microdeletion syndromes and has an incidence of in 5000 live births , while respectively the " pure " 1p36 microduplication has not been reported so far .
We present seven new patients who were referred for genetic evaluation due to Developmental Delay ( DD ) , Mental Retardation ( MR ) , and distinct dysmorphic features .
They all had a wide phenotypic spectrum .
In all cases previous standard karyotypes were negative .
Array-CGH analysis revealed five patients with interstitial 1p36 microdeletion ( four de novo and one maternal ) and two patients with de novo reciprocal duplication of different sizes .
These were the first reported " pure " 1p36 microduplication cases so far .
Three of our patients carrying the 1p36 microdeletion syndrome were also found to have additional pathogenetic aberrations .
These findings ( del 3q27.1 ; del 4q21.22-q22.1 ; del 16p13.3 ; dup 21q21.2-q21.3 ; del Xp22.12 ) might contribute to the patients ' severe phenotype , acting as additional modifiers of their clinical manifestations .
We review and compare the clinical and array-CGH findings of our patients to previously reported cases with the aim of clearly delineating more accurate genotype-phenotype correlations for the 1p36 syndrome that could allow for a more precise prognosis .
