Ruthenium(II) methylimidazole complexes , with the general formula [ Ru(MeIm)(4)(N⌢N)](2+) ( N⌢N=tip ( RMC1 ) , iip ( RMC2 ) , dppz ( RMC3 ) , dpq ( RMC4 ) ; MeIm=1-methylimidazole , tip=2-(thiophene-2-yl)-1H-imidazo [ 4,5-f ] [ 1,10]phenanthroline , iip=2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)-1H-imidazo [ 4,5-f ] [ 1,10]phenanthroline , dppz=dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine , dpq=pyrazino [ 2,3-f ] [ 1,10]phenanthroline ) , were synthesized and characterized .
As determined by MTT ( 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) assay , these complexes displayed potent anti-proliferation activity against various cancer cells .
RMC1 inhibited the growth of A549 ( human lung adenocarcinoma ) lung cells through induction of apoptotic cell death , as evidenced by the accumulation of cell population in sub-G1 phase .
RMC1 also induced the depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential in A549 cells by regulating the expression of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members .
Another experiment showed that Bid protein was also activated by RMC1 , which implied that RMC1 could existed two pathways crosstalk , namely , have exogenous death receptor signaling pathway .
These results demonstrated that RMC1 induced cancer cell death by acting on both mitochondrial and death receptor apoptotic pathways , suggesting that RMC1 could be a candidate for further evaluation as a chemotherapeutic agent against human cancers .
