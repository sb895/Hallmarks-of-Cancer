Landmark studies of the status of DNA damage checkpoints and associated repair functions in preneoplastic and neoplastic cells has focused attention on importance of these pathways in cancer development , and inhibitors of repair pathways are in clinical trials for treatment of triple negative breast cancer .
Cancer heterogeneity suggests that specific cancer subtypes will have distinct mechanisms of DNA damage survival , dependent on biological context .
In this study , status of DNA damage response ( DDR)-associated proteins was examined in breast cancer subtypes in association with clinical features ; 479 breast cancers were examined for expression of DDR proteins γH2AX , BRCA1 , pChk2 , and p53 , DNA damage-sensitive tumor suppressors Fhit and Wwox , and Wwox-interacting proteins Ap2α , Ap2γ , ErbB4 , and correlations among proteins , tumor subtypes , and clinical features were assessed .
In a multivariable model , triple negative cancers showed significantly reduced Fhit and Wwox , increased p53 and Ap2γ protein expression , and were significantly more likely than other subtype tumors to exhibit aberrant expression of two or more DDR-associated proteins .
Disease-free survival was associated with subtype , Fhit and membrane ErbB4 expression level and aberrant expression of multiple DDR-associated proteins .
These results suggest that definition of specific DNA repair and checkpoint defects in subgroups of triple negative cancer might identify new treatment targets .
Expression of Wwox and its interactor , ErbB4 , was highly significantly reduced in metastatic tissues vs. matched primary tissues , suggesting that Wwox signal pathway loss contributes to lymph node metastasis , perhaps by allowing survival of tumor cells that have detached from basement membranes , as proposed for the role of Wwox in ovarian cancer spread .
