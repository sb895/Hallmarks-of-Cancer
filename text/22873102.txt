OBJECTIVES To investigate the expression of TLR-4 ( toll-like receptor ) on human cervical cancer and find the biological function of the TLR-4 signal system .
METHODS The immunohistochemistry method was performed to study the protein expression and distribution of TLR-4 .
The viability of HeLa cells was determined by cell viability assay .
Cell proliferation was detected by FCM , ELISA and Western blot were used to observe the gene and protein expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 in Hela cell lines .
RESULTS TLR-4 was over-expressed in cervix cancer , and its activation by LPS promotes proliferation and anti-apoptosis in Hela cells in vitro .
Moreover the cell line proliferation increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner .
The production of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 were promoted through the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway .
