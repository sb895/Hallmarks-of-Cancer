BACKGROUND Helicobacter pylori is the main risk factor for the development of non-cardia gastric cancer .
Increased proliferation of the gastric mucosa is a feature of H. pylori infection .
Mucosal interkeukin-1beta production is increased in H. pylori infection and IL-1beta genotypes associated with increased pro-inflammatory activity are risk factors for the development of gastric cancer .
The effect of IL-1beta on gastric epithelial cell proliferation has been examined in this study .
METHODS AGS cells were cultured with IL-1beta .
DNA synthesis was assed by [ 3H]thymidine incorporation and total viable cell numbers by MTT assay .
RESULTS IL-1beta dose dependently increased DNA synthesis and cell numbers .
The enhanced proliferation was blocked by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist .
Addition of neutralising antibody to GM-CSF reduced IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation by 31 +/- 4 % .
GM-CSF alone significantly stimulated proliferation .
Addition or neutralisation of IL-8 had no effect on basal or IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation .
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein completely blocked IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation and inhibition of the extracellular signal related kinase pathway with PD 98059 inhibited IL-1beta stimulated proliferation by 58 +/- 5 % .
CONCLUSIONS IL-1beta stimulates proliferation in gastric epithelial cells .
Autocrine stimulation by GM-CSF contributes to this proliferative response .
Signalling via tyrosine kinase activity is essential to the mitogenic response to IL-1beta .
The extracellular signal related kinase pathway is involved in , but not essential to downstream signalling .
IL-1beta may contribute to the hyperproliferation seen in H. pylori- infected gastric mucosa , and be involved in the carcinogenic process .
