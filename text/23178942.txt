Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein consisting of a catalytic subunit , the telomerase reverse transcriptase , TERT , and an integrally associated RNA , TR , which contains a template for the synthesis of short repetitive G-rich DNA sequences at the ends of telomeres .
Telomerase can repetitively reverse transcribe its short RNA template , acting processively to add multiple telomeric repeats onto the same DNA substrate .
The contribution of enzyme processivity to telomere length regulation in human cells is not well characterized .
In cancer cells , under homeostatic telomere length-maintenance conditions , telomerase acts processively , while under nonequilibrium conditions , telomerase acts distributively on the shortest telomeres .
To investigate the role of increased telomerase processivity on telomere length regulation in human cells with limited lifespan that are dependent on human TERT ( hTERT ) for lifespan extension and immortalization , we mutated the leucine at position 866 in the reverse transcriptase C motif of hTERT to a tyrosine ( L866Y ) , which is the amino acid found at a similar position in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase .
We report that , similar to the previously reported ' gain of function ' Tetrahymena telomerase mutant ( L813Y ) , the human telomerase variant displays increased processivity. hTERT-L866Y , like wild-type hTERT can immortalize and extend the lifespan of limited lifespan cells .
Moreover , hTERT-L866Y expressing cells display heterogenous telomere lengths , telomere elongation , multiple telomeric signals indicative of fragile sites and replicative stress , and an increase in short telomeres , which is accompanied by telomere trimming events .
Our results suggest that telomere length and homeostasis in human cells may be regulated by telomerase enzyme processivity .
