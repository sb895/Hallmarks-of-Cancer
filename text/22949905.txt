Anal canal cancer is a rare tumor without clear treatment evidence in the metastatic setting .
In terms of the bad prognosis of patients with metastatic anal cancer , further therapeutic options are urgently needed .
In this paper we present the case of a 64-year-old man suffering from undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma with liver metastases .
After progression on cisplatin and fluorouracil , tumor tissue was analyzed with respect to anti-EGFR therapy with cetuximab .
There was no KRAS mutation and the EGFR expression level in the tumor tissue was 2+ ; ideal conditions for the immunotherapy .
Encouraged by these results we started a therapy using FOLFIRI in combination with cetuximab .
Fortunately the patient showed a partial response after 6 cycles .
On patient's preference we did a therapy break of 6 weeks .
Within this time period the disease was progressive indicating its aggressiveness .
However , the same immunotherapy was able to stabilize the disease for a further 3 months .
The patient died 21 months after diagnosis because of liver failure .
Nevertheless , from our perspective the combination of FOLFIRI and cetuximab is quite a promising therapeutic option for patients with metastatic anal cancer .
Potential predictive factors of the immunochemotherapy are discussed in this paper .
