Olfactomedin 4 ( OLFM4 ) is highly expressed in gastrointestinal cancers and has an anti-apoptotic function .
The roles of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis and how it functions in these processes remain elusive .
We investigated the function of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis using B16F10 mouse melanoma cells as an experimental system .
Our results showed that OLFM4 had no positive effect on cell viability or cell cycle progression in B16F10 cells .
However , it significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of B16F10 cells , i.e. , intradermal primary tumor growth and lung metastasis .
OLFM4 also suppressed the migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro .
For further insight into the mechanisms underlying OLFM4-mediated suppression of tumor progression , we examined the effect of OLFM4 on the expression of integrin and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) , both of which are involved in tumor progression .
Overexpression of OLFM4 clearly reduced the expression levels of integrin α1 , integrin α4 , integrin α5 , integrin α6 , and MMP9 .
Moreover , forced expression of MMP9 attenuated the inhibitory activity of OLFM4 on migration and invasiveness .
Our findings provide the experimental evidence that OLFM4 may function as a tumor suppressor and an anti-metastatic gene during tumor progression .
