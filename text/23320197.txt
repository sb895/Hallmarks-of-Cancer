The Punica granatum L. var. granatum ( pomegranate ) has been demonstrated to exert antitumor effects on various types of cancer cells .
The present study aimed to evaluate the medicinal herbs Punica granatum L. var. spinosa ( apple punice ) that are native to Iran .
This study was determined to test the possible cytotoxic activity and induction of apoptosis on human prostate cell lines .
The effect of ethanol extracts of the herbs on the inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by MTT colorimetric assay .
PC3 cell lines treated with the extracts were analyzed for the induction of apoptosis by cell death detection ( ELISA ) and TUNEL assay .
Dye exclusion analysis was performed for viability rate .
Our results demonstrated that the Punica granatum L. var. spinosa extract dose dependently suppressed the proliferation of PC3 cells ( IC(50)= 250.21 μg/mL ) when compared with a chemotherapeutic anticancer drug ( Toxol ) ( Vesper Pharmaceuticals ) with increased nucleosome production from apoptotic cells .
The Punica granatum L. var. spinosa extract attenuated the human prostate cell proliferation in vitro possibly by inducing apoptosis .
The Punica granatum L. var. spinosa is likely to be valuable for the treatment of some forms of human prostate cell line .
