Mode of action ( MOA ) analysis provides a systematic description of key events leading to adverse health effects in animal bioassays for the purpose of informing human health risk assessment .
Uncertainties and data gaps identified in the MOA analysis may also be used to guide future research to improve understanding of the MOAs underlying a specific toxic response and foster development of toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic models .
An MOA analysis , consistent with approaches outlined in the MOA Framework as described in the Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment , was conducted to evaluate small intestinal tumors observed in mice chronically exposed to relatively high concentrations of hexavalent chromium ( Cr(VI) ) in drinking water .
Based on review of the literature , key events in the MOA are hypothesized to include saturation of the reductive capacity of the upper gastrointestinal tract , absorption of Cr(VI) into the intestinal epithelium , oxidative stress and inflammation , cell proliferation , direct and/or indirect DNA modification , and mutagenesis .
Although available data generally support the plausibility of these key events , several unresolved questions and data gaps were identified , highlighting the need for obtaining critical toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic data in the target tissue and in the low-dose range .
Experimental assays that can address these data gaps are discussed along with strategies for comparisons between responsive and nonresponsive tissues and species .
This analysis provides a practical application of MOA Framework guidance and is instructive for the design of studies to improve upon the information available for quantitative risk assessment .
