Background/Aims : Cimetidine has been shown to play an important role in the treatment of cancer and the regulation of the immune system .
Therefore , we aimed to observe the effects of cimetidine on the systematic immune response in the perioperative period .
Methodology : Sixty patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled from Jan 2005 to Dec 2005 from Taizhou Hospital .
The patients were administrated with cimetidine ( 0.8g�d-1 or 1.2g�d-1 ) or saline from the day of admission to the 10th POD .
Venous blood sample was collected and the T- , B- and NK-lymphocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry .
The specimens were subjected to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) response examination .
Results : The levels of CD3 and CD4 T-lymphocytes were increased significantly in both low and high dose cimetidine groups 10 days after operation .
The number of CD19 B cells was also elevated by cimetidine .
However , no significant changes were observed in the CD8 , CD4/CD8 value .
TIL responses in the cimetidine groups were also enhanced significantly .
Conclusions : Cimetidine can alleviate systematic immunosuppression and improve the local immune function of the colorectal cancer patients in the perioperative period .
