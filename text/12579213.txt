During the period of 1996-1998 ninety-four gastrectomy specimens with gastric carcinoma referred to Erciyes University , Medical Faculty , Department of Pathology , were examined histopathologically , histochemically and immunohistochemically .
General characteristics of gastric carcinomas and prognostic factors were studied .
According the Lauren classification , of the 94 cases of gastric carcinomas , 56 were intestinal type , 21 were diffuse type and 17 were mixed type carcinoma .
The association rates of Helicobacter pylori , chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia with gastric carcinomas were high .
There was strong immunorectivity with HSP70 in 62,5% of the intestinal type carcinomas .
This ratios were lower in diffuse and mixed type carcinomas ( p<0.05 ) .
The more tumor size and invasion depth increased , the more HSP70 immunoreactivity was obtained ( p<0.05 ) .
HSP70 immunorectivity was considerably higher in the patients having lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion ( p<0.05 ) .
It was found that the NK cell number was low in the tumor but higher around the tumor in early gastric carcinomas , compared with advanced carcinomas ( p>0.05 ) .
In the tumors larger than 10 cm with vascular invasion , NK cell number was lower around the tumor ( p>0.05 ) .
Defining prognostic factors of gastric carcinomas is of importance to clinicians .
It is thought that HSP70 immunoreactivity , besides invasion depth , lymph node metastasis , vascular invasion , tumor size and inflammatory reaction against the tumor , is important in prognosis and associated with advanced stage .
