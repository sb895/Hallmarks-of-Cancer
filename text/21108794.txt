BACKGROUND To identify potential tumor suppressor genes , genome-wide data from exome and transcriptome sequencing were combined to search for genes with loss of heterozygosity and allele-specific expression .
The analysis was conducted on the breast cancer cell line HCC1954 , and a lymphoblast cell line from the same individual , HCC1954BL .
RESULTS By comparing exome sequences from the two cell lines , we identified loss of heterozygosity events at 403 genes in HCC1954 and at one gene in HCC1954BL .
The combination of exome and transcriptome sequence data also revealed 86 and 50 genes with allele specific expression events in HCC1954 and HCC1954BL , which comprise 5.4% and 2.6% of genes surveyed , respectively .
Many of these genes identified by loss of heterozygosity and allele-specific expression are known or putative tumor suppressor genes , such as BRCA1 , MSH3 and SETX , which participate in DNA repair pathways .
CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that the combined application of high throughput sequencing to exome and allele-specific transcriptome analysis can reveal genes with known tumor suppressor characteristics , and a shortlist of novel candidates for the study of tumor suppressor activities .
