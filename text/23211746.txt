Lesion-specific enzymes repair different forms of DNA damage , yet all lesions elicit the same checkpoint response .
The common intermediate required to mount a checkpoint response is thought to be single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) , coated by replication protein A ( RPA ) and containing a primer-template junction .
To identify factors important for initiating the checkpoint response , we screened for genes that , when overexpressed , could amplify a checkpoint signal to a weak allele of chk1 in fission yeast .
We identified Ast1 , a novel member of the XPG-related family of endo/exonucleases .
Ast1 promotes checkpoint activation caused by the absence of the other XPG-related nucleases , Exo1 and Rad2 , the homologue of Fen1 .
Each nuclease is recruited to DSBs , and promotes the formation of ssDNA for checkpoint activation and recombinational repair .
For Rad2 and Exo1 , this is independent of their S-phase role in Okazaki fragment processing .
This XPG-related pathway is distinct from MRN-dependent responses , and each enzyme is critical for damage resistance in MRN mutants .
Thus , multiple nucleases collaborate to initiate DNA damage responses , highlighting the importance of these responses to cellular fitness .
