The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor .
Recent studies have reported the anti-tumor effects of the AhR in breast cancer .
In this study , we investigated the anti-tumor effect of AhR activation based on the cancer stem cell hypothesis .
We show that AhR activation suppressed mammosphere formation of MCF-7 cells and decreased the proportion of cells with high ALDH-1 ( aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 ) activity .
In addition , we also demonstrate that AhR activation regulates self-renewal signaling by down-regulating Wnt/β-catenin and Notch .
