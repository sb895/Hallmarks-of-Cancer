ANXA2 , a member of the annexin family , is overexpressed and plays important roles in tumor development .
However , the significance of ANXA2 expression in gastric carcinoma has not been clarified.To elucidate its roles in growth of gastric cancer , ANXA2 expression in SGC-7901 cells was inhibited with a designated siRNA , then cell proliferation , cell cycling , apoptosis and motility were determined by MTT assay , flow cytometry , Hoechst 33342 staining and wound healing assay , respectively .
To further assess the behavior of ANXA2 deleted SGC- 7901 cells , changes of microstructures were observed under fluorescence microscopy , laser scanning confocal microscopy and electron microscopy .
We found that inhibition of ANXA2 expression caused cell proliferation to decrease significantly with G1 arrest , motility to be reduced with changes in pseudopodia/filopodia structure and F-actin and β-tubulin expression , and apoptosis to be enhanced albeit without significance .
At the same time , ANXA2 deletion resulted in fewer pseudopodia/filopodia , non-stained areas were increased , contact inhibition among cells reappeared , and expression of F-actin and β-tubulin was decreased , with induction of polymerized disassembled forms .
Taken together , these data suggest that ANXA2 overexpression is important to maintain the malignancy of cancer cells , and this member of the annexin family has potential to be considered as a target for the gene therapy of gastric carcinoma .
