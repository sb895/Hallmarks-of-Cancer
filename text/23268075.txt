We report a case of recurrent gastric cancer successfully treated by a combination of CPT-11 and CDDP as the third- line chemotherapy .
A 78-year-old man with advanced gastric cancer underwent a curative distal gastrectomy .
Three years later , the tumor marker level began to rise and computed tomography ( CT ) revealed lymph node metastasis invading the pancreas resulting in pancreatic duct dilatation .
S-1 treatment was initiated but was discontinued because of a systemic exanthem .
Paclitaxel was administrated as secondary chemotherapy .
But , after 2 courses , a further increase in the tumor marker level and portal vein invasion were observed .
Combination therapy of CPT-11 and CDDP was administered as the third-line chemotherapy .
After 3 courses , the tumor marker level normalized , tumor size decreased , and the invasion was eliminated .
Third-line chemotherapy against recurrent gastric cancer should be considered if patient performance status ( PS ) is maintained .
