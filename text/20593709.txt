OBJECTIVES To evaluate and compare the incidence , TNM staging and the current strate- gy for the surgical treatment of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) in two European urologic institutions , situated in Varna , Bulgaria and in Bari , Italy .
Both clinics have sound experience of RCC surgery , and modern laparoscopic equipment .
A retrospective chart review of all patients with RCC diagnosed and treated in the last year was conducted at the two sites .
MATERIALS AND METHODS In total , 88 patients ( 66 males and 22 females , mean age 58 years , range 24-81 years ) were enrolled in the study .
Comparisons were made between some clinical and pathologic parameters with an established prognostic and therapeutic impact .
The type of surgery perormed at both sites was analyzed as well .
All these comparative studies were performed in relation to the 2008 EAU guidelines on the current management of RCC .
Commercially available statistical software was used for the purpose .
RESULTS The results showed no difference between the two sites regarding the RCC incidence and the patients ' age and gender .
Significant differences ( p value < 0.0001 ) emerged in terms of : the median size of the tumors at surgery ( 8.5 cm in Varna , SD + 4.04 vs. 4.4 cm in Bari , SD _ 2.02 ) ; T-stage of the tumor ( Varna T T2-30% , T3-22% , T4-15% vs. Bari T1-64% , T2-12% , T3-24% , T4-0% ) ; N-positive disese ( 24% vs. 2% ) ; distant metastases ( 20% vs. 2% ) and presence of necrosis in the renal masses ( 37% vs. 19% ) .
Thus , 85% of Varna patients underwent open radical nephrectomy , 11% nephron-sparing surgery and 4% explorative laparotomy , due to inoperability of the renal mass .
Only 29% of Bari patients were treated by open radical nephrectomy , 12% underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy , 57% open partial nephrectomy and 2% laparoscopic partial tumor resection .
Conclusions : These numbers demonstrate more advantageous tumour features at the Italian clinic in terms of organ-sparing surgical options ( open and laparoscopic ) , whereas in the Bulgarian clinic the tumour features pose certain limitations to the application of modern surgical techniques .
This difference is due to early diagnosis of RCC in Italy , allowing treatment of smaller volume tumors .
