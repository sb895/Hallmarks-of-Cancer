Autophagy is one of the survival processes of cancer cells , especially in stressful conditions such as starvation , hypoxia and chemotherapeutic agents .
However , its roles in tumor survival have not yet been fully elucidated .
Here , we found for the first time that JAK2/STAT3 was activated in HeLa cells when they were starved or treated with rapamycin .
STAT3 activation was associated with autophagic processes , because it was completely inhibited by 3-methyladenine , partially inhibited by knockdown of molecules associated with autophagic processes and blocked by antioxidants , DPI , a Nox inhibitor and knockdown of p22 phox , indicating that ROS generated by Nox that was activated during autophagic processes activated JAK2/STAT3 pathway .
Activated STAT3 directly bound to IL6 promoter and increased IL6 mRNA and protein secretion .
Finally , the conditioned media , which included IL6 , from starved HeLa cells promoted cancer cell survival in both normal and starved conditions , confirmed by clonogenic , proliferation and cell death assays .
These data together indicate that the autophagic process in cancer cells can contribute to their survival by JAk2/STAT3 activation and subsequent secretion of growth factors .
