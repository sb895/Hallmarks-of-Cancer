OBJECTIVE To clarify the relationship between the expression of pol beta and DNA damage /repair induced by Benzo(a)pyrene ( BaP ) .
METHODS pol beta wild-type cells ( pol beta +/+ ) , pol beta null cells ( pol beta -/- ) and wild-type pol beta overexpressed cells ( pol beta oe ) which had the same genetic background were studied .
Firstly , RT-PCR and Western blot targeting to pol beta were carried out to measure the expression of pol beta mRNA and protein in above three kinds of cells , then MTT test and single cell gel electrophoresis ( comet assay ) were used to compare cell viability and DNA damage/repair of the three kinds of cells when exposed to BaP .
RESULTS There was pol beta deletion in pol beta -/- cells and the level of pol beta mRNA and protein in pol beta oe cells was twice higher than that in pol beta +/+ cells .
BaP could induce DNA damage and reduce cell viability , when compared with pol beta +/+ cells , IC50 of pol beta -/- cells was remarkably lower , DNA was prone to damage and more difficult to be repaired , on the other hand , IC50 of pol beta oe cells was obviously higher and the damage effect on DNA was weaker and prone to be repaired .
CONCLUSION Pol beta played an important role in the repair of DNA damage induced by BaP , deficiency of pol beta could decrease the DNA repair capability of cells , and overexpression of pol beta could help cells response to DNA damage and protect cells from death in a certain degree .
