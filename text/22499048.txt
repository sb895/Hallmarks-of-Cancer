A variety of reduced-intensity conditionings have been used in the reported studies of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) for elderly patients with myeloid hematological malignancies .
This study retrospectively analyzed the outcome of allogeneic HSCT for 10 patients aged 50 years or older with myeloid hematological malignancies after conditioning with fludarabine ( 125 mg/m(2) ) , melphalan ( 140 mg/m(2) ) and total body irradiation ( TBI ; 8 Gy ) .
Median age of the patients was 56.5 years , and diagnoses included acute myelogenous leukemia , advance myelodysplastic syndrome , and secondary myelofibrosis .
Sources of stem cells were bone marrow from sibling ( n=4 ) or unrelated donor ( n=6 ) .
Both overall and disease-free survival rates were 40.0% ( 95% CI : 10.6 Causes of death were relapse ( n=2 ) , fungal infection ( n=2 ) , and secondary malignancies ( n=2 ) .
Because of a high incidence of transplant-related mortality , further refinement of this conditioning is required .
