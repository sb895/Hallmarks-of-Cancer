Recent research has shown that the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit is a novel anti-cancer target , which plays pivotal roles in malignant cell ion transport , metabolism , migration and signal transduction .
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the anti-cancer effects of ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 small interfering ribonucleic acid ( siRNA ) on HepG2 cell proliferation , apoptosis and cell cycle , and to explore the molecular mechanisms .
The expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , normal liver tissues and human HCC line ( HepG2 , SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402 ) has been investigated .
Using the ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit siRNA , which target the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase , we have evaluated the effects of inhibiting Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 in human HepG2 cells with respect to cell proliferation , morphology , cell cycle , impact on intracellular Ca2++ , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) concentration , and correlated gene expression level on messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) and protein .
Our data showed that the expression Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in HCC tissues is higher than that in normal liver tissues .
Ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 siRNA could inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation .
Ouabain could induce HepG2 cell apoptosis and generate S phase arrest , and siRNA could enhance the anti-cancer effect of ouabain that induced HepG2 cells apoptosis via an intracellular Ca(2+) and ROS increase-mediated , and generated cell cycle S phase arresting by decreasing the CyclinA1/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2)/proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) complex product and increasing the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ( P21(CIP1) ) .
We believe that targeting of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in human HCC cells could provide new sight into the treatment of HCC .
