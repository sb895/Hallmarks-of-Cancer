A 39-year-old male without contributory medical history had sustained progressive double vision , ptosis , and trigeminal pain for 2 weeks .
Physical examination revealed total ophthalmoplegia and visual field defect with normal blood examination and chest radiography .
Cranial computed tomography revealed a hyperdense mass in the left frontotemporal fossae with bony erosion .
Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a broad-based , intensely enhanced extraaxial tumor of 4x4x4 cm diameter with dural tail sign .
Cerebral angiography demonstrated insignificant blood supply both from the internal carotid and middle meningeal arteries .
Nearly total tumor resection was achieved via orbitofrontotemporal craniotomy .
Intraoperative findings revealed the extraaxial tumor with broad attachment to the dura mater and invasion to the optic and oculomotor nerves .
Histological examination revealed hypercellular tumor with significant cell atypism , mitotic activity , and focal necrosis .
Immunohistochemical staining was positive for AE1/3 and c-kit , but negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein .
Systemic examination performed postoperatively revealed a thymic tumor without additional remote lesions .
The final diagnosis was metastatic brain tumor from thymic carcinoma .
Rapid progression of neurological impairment inconsistent with a benign extraaxial tumor needs prompt surgical intervention .
