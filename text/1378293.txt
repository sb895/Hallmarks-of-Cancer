A new cell line , CB109 , has been established from a human glioblastoma multiforme .
The cytoskeleton was positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein , vimentin and fibronectin .
Hyaluronan ( HA ) and the HA-binding protein hyaluronectin ( HN ) were expressed in the cell cytoplasm and in the extracellular matrix of spheroids and plated cells .
Hyaluronidase did not prevent spheroid formation suggesting that HA was not involved in the cell-cell adhesion .
HA precoating prevented cell adherence to the plates and favoured spheroid formation .
HA was secreted in relatively large amounts into the culture medium .
High performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that HA was in the high molecular weight form .
The rate of HN secretion by cells was very low .
Basic fibroblast growth factor significantly increased the proliferation in vitro and tumour growth after grafting into nude mice .
The epidermal growth factor receptor was not expressed on cultivated CB109 cells .
Cytogenetic analysis showed polysomy 7 , structural rearrangement of chromosome 10 short arm and a translocation 13q13-q14 without detectable alteration of the RB gene .
