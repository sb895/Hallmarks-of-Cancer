Although the immunomodulatory effects of many herbs have been extensively studied , research related to possible immunomodulatory effects of various spices is relatively scarce .
Here , the potential immunomodulatory effects of black pepper and cardamom are investigated .
Our data show that black pepper and cardamom aqueous extracts significantly enhance splenocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent , synergistic fashion .
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments reveal that black pepper and cardamom significantly enhance and suppress , respectively , T helper ( Th)1 cytokine release by splenocytes .
Conversely , Th2 cytokine release by splenocytes is significantly suppressed and enhanced by black pepper and cardamom , respectively .
Experimental evidence suggests that black pepper and cardamom extracts exert pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles , respectively .
Consistently , nitric oxide production by macrophages is significantly augmented and reduced by black pepper and cardamom , respectively .
Remarkably , it is evident that black pepper and cardamom extracts significantly enhance the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells , indicating their potential anti-cancer effects .
Our findings strongly suggest that black pepper and cardamom exert immunomodulatory roles and antitumor activities , and hence they manifest themselves as natural agents that can promote the maintenance of a healthy immune system .
We anticipate that black pepper and cardamom constituents can be used as potential therapeutic tools to regulate inflammatory responses and prevent/attenuate carcinogenesis .
