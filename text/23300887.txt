Novel strategies are necessary to improve chemotherapy response in advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer .
Here , we demonstrate that terpenoids present in the Steam Distilled Extract of Ginger ( SDGE ) are potent inhibitors of proliferation of endometrial cancer cells .
SDGE , isolated from six different batches of ginger rhizomes , consistently inhibited proliferation of the endometrial cancer cell lines Ishikawa and ECC-1 at IC(50) of 1.25 �g/ml .
SDGE also enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of radiation and cisplatin .
Decreased proliferation of Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells was a direct result of SDGE-induced apoptosis as demonstrated by FITC-Annexin V staining and expression of cleaved caspase 3 .
GC/MS analysis identified a total of 22 different terpenoid compounds in SDGE , with the isomers neral and geranial constituting 30-40% .
Citral , a mixture of neral and geranial inhibited the proliferation of Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells at an IC(50) 10 �M ( 2.3 �g/ml ) .
Phenolic compounds such as gingerol and shogaol were not detected in SDGE and 6-gingerol was a weaker inhibitor of the proliferation of the endometrial cancer cells .
SDGE was more effective in inducing cancer cell death than citral , suggesting that other terpenes present in SDGE were also contributing to endometrial cancer cell death .
SDGE treatment resulted in a rapid and strong increase in intracellular calcium and a 20-40% decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential .
Ser-15 of p53 was phosphorylated after 15 min treatment of the cancer cells with SDGE .
This increase in p53 was associated with 90% decrease in Bcl2 whereas no effect was observed on Bax .
Inhibitor of p53 , pifithrin-α , attenuated the anti-cancer effects of SDGE and apoptosis was also not observed in the p53(neg) SKOV-3 cells .
Our studies demonstrate that terpenoids from SDGE mediate apoptosis by activating p53 and should be therefore be investigated as agents for the treatment of endometrial cancer .
