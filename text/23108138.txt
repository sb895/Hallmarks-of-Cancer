The relevance of many BRCA2 variants of uncertain significance ( VUS ) to breast cancer has not been determined due to limited genetic information from families carrying these alterations .
Here , we classified six new variants as pathogenic or nonpathogenic by analysis of genetic information from families carrying 64 individual BRCA2 DNA binding domain ( DBD ) missense mutations using a multifactorial likelihood model of cancer causality .
Next , we evaluated the use of a homology-directed DNA break repair ( HDR ) functional assay as a method for inferring the clinical relevance of VUS in the DBD of BRCA2 using 18 established nonpathogenic missense variants and all 13 established pathogenic missense mutations from the BRCA2 DBD .
Compared with the known status of these variants based on the multifactorial likelihood model , the sensitivity of the HDR assay for pathogenic mutations was estimated at 100% [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 75.3%-100% ] and specificity was estimated at 100% ( 95% CI : 81.5%-100% ) .
A statistical classifier for predicting the probability of pathogenicity of BRCA2 DBD variants was developed using these functional results .
When applied to 33 additional VUS , the classifier identified eight with 99% or more probability of nonpathogenicity and 18 with 99% or more probability of pathogenicity .
Thus , in the absence of genetic evidence , a cell-based HDR assay can provide a probability of pathogenicity for all VUS in the BRCA2 DBD , suggesting that the assay can be used in combination with other information to determine the cancer relevance of BRCA2 VUS .
