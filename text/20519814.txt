A 33-year-old man presented with pain and palsy of the leg in 2008 for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with huge distant metastases .
The patient's tumors had slowly enlarged despite several treatments .
Oral administration of sorafenib at 800 mg/day with careful observation was commenced in 2009 .
Laboratory investigations on day 7 showed massive tumor lysis .
An abdominal CT showed multiple low density areas and tumor markers decreased , indicating extended tumor necrosis .
In conclusion , clinicians should bear in mind not only the published adverse effects , but also massive tumor lysis , when treating patients with large tumor burden by sorafenib .
