Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol that exhibits pleiotropic health beneficial effects , including anti-inflammatory , cardio-protective , and cancer-protective activities .
It is recognized as one of the more promising natural molecules in the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders .
Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic , chronic inflammatory disease of the colon associated with a high colon cancer risk .
Here , we used a dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) mouse model of colitis , which resembles human ulcerative colitis pathology .
Resveratrol mixed in food ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in mice in a dose-dependent manner .
Resveratrol significantly improves inflammation score , downregulates the percentage of neutrophils in the mesenteric lymph nodes and lamina propria , and modulates CD3(+) T cells that express tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IFN-gamma .
Markers of inflammation and inflammatory stress ( p53 and p53-phospho-Ser(15) ) are also downregulated by resveratrol .
Because chronic colitis drives colon cancer risk , we carried out experiments to determine the chemopreventive properties of resveratrol .
Tumor incidence is reduced from 80% in mice treated with azoxymethane ( AOM ) + DSS to 20% in mice treated with AOM + DSS + resveratrol ( 300 ppm ) .
Tumor multiplicity also decreased with resveratrol treatment .
AOM + DSS-treated mice had 2.4 +/- 0.7 tumors per animal compared with AOM + DSS + 300 ppm resveratrol , which had 0.2 +/- 0.13 tumors per animal .
The current study indicates that resveratrol is a useful , nontoxic complementary and alternative strategy to abate colitis and potentially colon cancer associated with colitis .
