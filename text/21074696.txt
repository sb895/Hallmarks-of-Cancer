Rhabdoid tumors have been reported in many different anatomic sites as an aggressive tumor and usually present with a rhabdoid tumor component ( a composite tumor ) rather than a pure rhabdoid tumor .
Rhabdoid tumor in the prostate has been described only once in the prostatic region as a possible epithelial origin .
Rhabdoid features in prostatic stromal sarcomas ( PSSs ) have never been described in the literature .
Here , we report a case of a PSS with rhabdoid features .
A 31-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of voiding difficulty and anal pain .
Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an ovoid mass in the prostate invading rectum and urinary bladder .
A needle biopsy was diagnosed as an unclassified spindle cell sarcoma , and 2 cycles of adriamycin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy were given , followed by radical prostatectomy .
The prostatectomy specimen revealed a high-grade sarcoma with fascicles of highly cellular spindle cells and numerous mitoses with hemorrhage and necrosis .
In areas , the tumor also contained sheets of loosely cohesive epithelioid cells with rhabdoid tumor component .
Both spindle and rhabdoid tumor cells were positive for vimentin , CD34 , and progesterone receptor and negative for desmin and cytokeratin immunostainings .
The rhabdoid tumor cells retained INI1 expression .
The tumor recurred in the bladder , and the patient died of sepsis .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first case of PSS with rhabdoid features .
The tumor showed an aggressive clinical behavior with a short-term survival ( 7 months after diagnosis ) .
