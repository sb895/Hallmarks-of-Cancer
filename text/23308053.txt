The expression of the angiogenic phenotype is regulated by a balance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors released into the tumor microenvironment .
Nuclear protein 7 ( NOL7 ) , a novel tumor suppressor , acts as a master regulator of angiogenesis by downregulating pro-angiogenic factors and upregulating anti-angiogenic factors .
Using cervical cancer as a model of investigation , we have previously shown that loss of NOL7 mRNA and protein expression is observed as early as the premalignant phase .
Analysis of the gene failed to identify tumor-specific promoter methylation or coding region mutations , suggesting that NOL7 loss may be mediated by aberrant expression of its upstream regulators .
In this study , we show that the RB tumor suppressor gene ( RB ) positively regulates NOL7 at the transcriptional level by recruiting transcription factors and transcription machinery proteins to its promoter region .
Conversely , the loss of RB represses NOL7 transcription by inhibiting assembly of these proteins .
This loss of NOL7 expression is also observed in RB-deficient human malignancies .
Together , this work further characterizes the transcriptional activator function of RB and defines a potential role for RB in regulating angiogenesis through activation of NOL7 .
Current anti-angiogenic therapies lack long-term efficacy , as they are unable to target the diverse angiogenic signals generated by tumors .
Our data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that reactivation of pRB can potentially modulate the expression of the angiogenic phenotype through regulation of NOL7 .
Therefore , this knowledge may be employed to design more comprehensive and effective therapies .
