Bone is the second most common metastatic site in patients with renal cell carcinoma presenting with metastases ( mRCC ) at diagnosis .
Complications of metastatic bone disease , including bone pain , fractures , spinal cord compression , and hypercalcaemia , are the primary cause of decline in the quality of life of patients with mRCC .
Currently , treatment for mRCC bone metastases is generally palliative .
Bisphosphonates are also used ; however , the efficacy of bisphosphonates in conjunction with targeted agents is currently unknown .
As growth factors play a critical role in the development of bone metastases , there is a biological rationale for the use of targeted agents to treat them .
We report here the case of two patients with mRCC with surgically unresectable sacral bone metastases treated with sunitinib , who are still alive with long-term stabilization of metastases of 48 and 31 months .
Results suggest targeted agents such as sunitinib may be an effective treatment for bone metastases .
