Background .
An important goal of personalized cancer therapy is to tailor specific therapies to the mutational profile of individual patients .
However , whole genome sequencing studies have shown that the mutational profiles of cancers evolve over time and often differ between primary and metastatic sites .
Activating point mutations in the PIK3CA gene are common in primary breast cancer tumors , but their presence in breast cancer bone metastases has not been assessed previously .
Results .
Fourteen patients with breast cancer bone metastases were biopsied by three methods : CT-guided bone biopsies ; bone marrow trephine biopsies ; and bone marrow aspiration .
Samples that were positive for cancer cells were obtained from six patients .
Three of these patients had detectable PIK3CA mutations in bone marrow cancer cells .
Primary tumor samples were available for four of the six patients assessed for PIK3CA status in their bone metastases .
For each of these , the PIK3CA mutation status was the same in the primary and metastatic sites .
Conclusions .
PIK3CA mutations occur frequently in breast cancer bone metastases .
The PIK3CA mutation status in bone metastases samples appears to reflect the PIK3CA mutation status in the primary tumour .
Breast cancer patients with bone metastases may be candidates for treatment with selective PIK3CA inhibitors .
