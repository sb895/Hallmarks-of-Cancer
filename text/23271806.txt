Each year , more than 700,000 people undergo cancer surgery in the United States .
However , more than 40% of those patients develop recurrences and have a poor outcome .
Traditionally , the medical community has assumed that recurrent tumors arise from selected tumor clones that are refractory to therapy .
However , we found that tumor cells have few phenotypical differences after surgery .
Thus , we propose an alternative explanation for the resistance of recurrent tumors .
Surgery promotes inhibitory factors that allow lingering immunosuppressive cells to repopulate small pockets of residual disease quickly .
Recurrent tumors and draining lymph nodes are infiltrated with M2 ( CD11b(+)F4/80(hi)CD206(hi) and CD11b(+)F4/80(hi)CD124(hi) ) macrophages and CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells .
This complex network of immunosuppression in the surrounding tumor microenvironment explains the resistance of tumor recurrences to conventional cancer vaccines despite small tumor size , an intact antitumor immune response , and unaltered cancer cells .
Therapeutic strategies coupling antitumor agents with inhibition of immunosuppressive cells potentially could impact the outcomes of more than 250,000 people each year .
