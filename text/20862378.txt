In this study , we compared the effects of SKI-606 with Iressa , Src/Abl and EGF-R kinase inhibitors , respectively , on selected parameters in HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines , which express E6/E7 oncoproteins of high-risk HPV types 18 and 16 , respectively .
Our results show that SKI-606 and Iressa inhibit cell proliferation and provoke G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest and reduction of S and G(2)-M phase using 2 and 5 μM concentrations of these inhibitors .
In contrast , SKI-606 induces differentiation to an epithelial phenotype " mesenchymal-epithelial transition " ; thus SKI-606 causes a dramatic decrease in cell motility and invasion abilities of HeLa and SiHa cancer cells , in comparison to untreated cells and Iressa-treated cells in which these parameters are only slightly affected .
These changes are accompanied by a regulation of the expression patterns of E-cadherin and catenins .
The molecular pathway analysis of Src/Abl inhibitor revealed that SKI-606 blocks the phosphorylation of β-catenin and consequently converts its role from a transcriptional regulator to a cell-cell adhesion molecule .
Our findings indicate that SKI-606 inhibits signaling pathways involved in regulating tumor cell migration and invasion genes via β-catenin alteration , suggesting that Src inhibitor , in comparison to EGF-R , is a promising therapeutic agent for human cervical cancer .
