Many human cellular and tissue compartments are supersaturated with respect to calcium oxyanion salts .
In order to prevent the formation of injurious crystals efficient anti-crystallization protective mechanisms must be necessary .
We suggest that depletion of such systems , particularly in ageing organisms and under conditions of oxidative stress , plays an important role in degenerative and inflammatory diseases , including cancer .
