Modeling the behavior of mammalian arachnoid cells is critical to understand hydrocephalus and other brain disorders involving abnormal flow of cerebrospinal fluid , yet relatively little is known about the physiology of arachnoid cells due to lack of a robust three-dimensional model system .
Explanted primary cultures have been the only option to study transport across arachnoid cell membranes , but practical limitations of primary culture include slow growth , early senescence , and poor reproducibility .
The purpose of this study was to create immortalized rat arachnoid cell lines to permit in vitro study of arachnoid granulations and properties of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) flow .
We established and partially characterized two immortalized cell lines generated from primary rat arachnoid cells , using retroviral gene transfer of SV40 large T antigen ( SV40 LTAg ) either with or without human telomerase ( hTERT ) .
The established cell lines stably express either SV40 LTAg alone , or SV40 LTAg and hTERT , and demonstrate high proliferative rate , contact inhibition at confluence , and stable expression of protein markers characteristic of native arachnoid cells over more than 160 passages .
