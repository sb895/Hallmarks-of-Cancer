Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood vessels form existing vessels surrounding a tumor .
The process of angiogenesis is an important step for tumor growth and metastasis , as is inflammation .
Thus , angiogenesis inhibitors that suppress inflammation have been studied as an anticancer treatment .
Recently , many research groups have investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of natural compounds since some have been demonstrated to have anticancer properties .
Among many natural compounds , we focused on betaine , which is known to suppress inflammation .
Betaine , trimethylglycine ( TMG ) , was first discovered in the juice of sugar beets and was later shown to be present in wheat , shellfish and spinach .
In Southeast Asia , betaine is used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of hepatic disorders .
Here , we report the anti-angiogenic action of betaine .
Betaine inhibited invitro angiogenic cascade , tube formation , migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) .
Betaine also inhibited invivo angiogenesis in the mouse Matrigel plug assay .
The mRNA expression levels of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in HUVECs were decreased by betaine treatment .
In addition , betaine suppressed NF-κB and Akt activation .
