OBJECTIVES Oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory mediators have been implicated in breast carcinogenesis .
We attempted to evaluate the markers of oxidative stress , antioxidant mechanism and the inflammatory pathway in patients with breast cancer .
METHODS This study was carried out in departments of Biochemistry and Surgery , Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Hospitals , New Delhi , India .
A total of 60 cases of carcinoma of the breast and 60 healthy controls were included in the study .
The parameters that were assayed include markers of oxidative stress-conjugated dienes , thiobarbitone reactive substances ( TBARS ) , antioxidants-superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) , glutathione ( GSH ) and markers of inflammation-interleukin-6(IL-6) and ferritin .
RESULTS There was a significant decline in the antioxidant levels and a significant rise in oxidant levels in patients with carcinoma of the breast , compared to controls .
The inflammatory markers-IL-6 and ferritin-were also significantly higher in patients with breast cancer .
A significantly positive correlation was observed between the IL-6 levels and conjugated dienes with the stage of breast carcinoma ; whilst a significantly negative correlation was observed between the levels of conjugated dienes and superoxide dismutase and superoxide dismutase levels with the disease staging .
CONCLUSIONS This study underlines the interplay between inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of breast cancer .
MINI ABSTRACT : An intense research is underway to identify the possible risk factors and the molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of breast cancer .
Inflammation and oxidative stress are two such etiologies investigated in our study .
