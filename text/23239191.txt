Angiogenesis is essential for the growth , expansion and metastasis of human colorectal cancers ( CRCs ) .
Histamine produced by mast cells is a potent proangiogenic factor .
However , the significance of non-mast cell expressing histamine in the tumor microenvironment remains unknown .
In this study , we evaluated the histamine positive microvessels with the specific marker for biosynthesis of histamine L-histidine decarboxylase ( HDC ) in the CRC tumor microenvironment .
The relationship between HDC positive microvessel density ( HDC-MVD ) and clinical pathological parameters was assessed .
The results revealed that HDC-MVD in the tumor microenvironment of CRCs was significantly increased as compared with the controls .
CRC patients with lymph node invasion had a particularly higher density of HDC-MVD than those without .
The density of HDC-MVD accounted for of CD34 positive MVD in CRCs and double IHC analysis demonstrated that these HDC positive microvessels were mostly CD34 positive microvessels and with a high proliferative activity .
Our results suggest that histamine expressed in microvessels could be an additional cellular source and involved in the cancer invasion through promoting angiogenesis in human CRCs .
