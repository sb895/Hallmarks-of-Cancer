The main objective of the present investigation was to study the urinary neopterin excretion in the context of the activation of the adaptive cellular immune system at the tumor site .
For this purpose , we compared pre-treatment urinary neopterin levels measured in 92 ovarian cancer patients , with intratumoral levels of mRNA transcripts from factors either involved in the adaptive antitumor immune defense ( CD3 , IFN-γ , IRF-1 , IRF-2 , SOCS1 and iNOS ) or immune tolerance ( FoxP3 ) .
This study did not reveal an association between urinary neopterin and one of these investigated " on tumor site transcripts " .
From all the factors reflecting the magnitude of the local adaptive antitumor response , intratumoral IRF-1 expression above the edge of the 25th percentile was found to predict most reliably favorable progression-free ( median 34 months vs. 10 months ; p < 0.001 ) and overall ( median 52 months vs. 16 months ; p < 0.001 ) survival .
In contrast , pre-treatment urinary neopterin excretion above 275 μmol/mol creatinine , which indicates an unspecific activation of the innate immune system , was associated with a very poor overall survival with a median of only 11 months when compared with a median overall survival of 40 months in patients with lower urinary neopterin excretion ( p = 0.021 ) .
Interestingly , the considerable survival benefit in patients with high IRF-1-expressing cancers was completely abrogated as well for progression-free as for overall survival when urinary neopterin concentrations were found to be concomitantly elevated .
These findings demonstrate that in ovarian carcinomas the unspecific " cancer-related inflammation " contributes to a significant subversion of the adaptive antitumor immune defense mounted at the tumor site .
