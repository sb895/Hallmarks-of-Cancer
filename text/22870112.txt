Overexpression of growth factors and/or their receptors is a common event in malignancy and provides the underlying mechanisms for one of the hallmarks of cancer , uncontrolled proliferation .
Mounting evidence suggests that IGF-1 is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different types of human cancer such as colon , breast , prostate and lung .
However , only a few studies have investigated the association between IGF-1 levels and childhood cancer risk .
We aimed to compare the IGF-1 serum level in children with de novo malignancies to healthy children , and to assess its relationship with cancer type , stage , metastasis and different disease characteristics .
The study was carried out on 100 children ; 50 children with de novo malignancies and 50 healthy children of matched age and gender as a control group .
The patients were subjected to a routine work-up for their cancers according to our local standards .
Estimation of the serum level of IGF-1 was carried out in the two groups using ELISA .
Our results showed that children with cancer had significantly higher levels of IGF-1 than healthy controls of the same age and gender .
No association was found between IGF-1 and tumor type , stage , metastasis and other disease characteristics .
In conclusion , the IGF-1 serum level is an important indicator of risk for the most prevalent forms of childhood cancer .
It may be used to identify children at the highest risk for these cancers and aid in determing who may benefit most from preventive strategies .
Given the small number of children in our study , studies with larger populations are required to confirm these results .
