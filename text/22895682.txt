Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) are generally used in tissue engineering , regenerative medicine and therapy for immune disorder disease .
MSCs are also employed as drug carriers for tumor therapy due to their ability to migrate to tumor tissue .
However , due to the immunosuppressive function of MSCs , the application of MSCs in prostate cancer therapy remains limited .
In this study , we investigated the underlying mechanism by which MSCs enable prostate cancer cells to escape from immune surveillance in the inflammatory microenvironment .
Firstly , we demonstrated that compared with the control groups , MSCs pretreated with IL-1α effectively promoted the growth of the mouse prostate cancer cell line RM-1 invivo .
Furthermore , when RM-1 prostate cancer cells were co-injected with MSCs pretreated with IL-1α , tumor incidence significantly increased in allogeneic recipients .
In addition , we investigated the mechanism through which MSCs promote the ability of RM-1 cells to escape from immune injury .
The results revealed that IL-1α led to the upregulation of TGF-β in MSCs .
The inflammatory cytokine-induced promotive effect of MSCs on RM-1 cells in vivo was inhibited by TGF-β siRNA .
The results of our study suggest that inflammatory cytokines induce the immunosuppressive function of MSCs which enables prostate cancer cells to escape from immune injury .
