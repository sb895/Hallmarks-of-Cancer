Loss of telomeric DNA during cell proliferation may play a role in ageing and cancer .
Since telomeres permit complete replication of eukaryotic chromosomes and protect their ends from recombination , we have measured telomere length , telomerase activity and chromosome rearrangements in human cells before and after transformation with SV40 or Ad5 .
In all mortal populations , telomeres shortened by approximately 65 bp/generation during the lifespan of the cultures .
When transformed cells reached crisis , the length of the telomeric TTAGGG repeats was only approximately 1.5 kbp and many dicentric chromosomes were observed .
In immortal cells , telomere length and frequency of dicentric chromosomes stabilized after crisis .
Telomerase activity was not detectable in control or extended lifespan populations but was present in immortal populations .
These results suggest that chromosomes with short ( TTAGGG)n tracts are recombinogenic , critically shortened telomeres may be incompatible with cell proliferation and stabilization of telomere length by telomerase may be required for immortalization .
