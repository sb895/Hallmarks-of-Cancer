Splenic haemangiosarcomas ( HSAs ) from 122 dogs were characterized and classified according to their patterns of growth , survival time post splenectomy , metastases and chemotherapy .
The most common pattern of growth was a mixture of cavernous , capillary and solid tumour tissue .
Survival time post splenectomy was independent of the growth pattern ; however , it was influenced by chemotherapy and metastases .
Immunohistochemical assessment of the expression of angiogenic factors ( fetal liver kinase-1 , angiopoietin-2 , angiopoietin receptor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor A ) and conventional endothelial markers ( CD31 , factor VIII-related antigen ) revealed variable expression , particularly in undifferentiated HSAs .
Therefore , a combination of endothelial markers should be used to confirm the endothelial origin of splenic tumours .
