We have evaluated DNA damage ( DNA adduct formation ) after feeding benzo[a]pyrene ( BP ) to wild-type ( WT ) and cancer-susceptible Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice deficient in nucleotide excision repair and haploinsufficient for the tumor suppressor p53 .
DNA damage was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC/ES-MS/MS ) , which measures r7,t8,t9-trihydroxy-c-10-(N ( 2)-deoxyguanosyl)-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( BPdG ) , and a chemiluminescence immunoassay ( CIA ) , using anti-r7,t8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( BPDE)-DNA antiserum , which measures both BPdG and the other stable BP-DNA adducts .
When mice were fed 100 ppm BP for 28 days , BP-induced DNA damage measured in esophagus , liver and lung was typically higher in Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice , compared with WT mice .
This result is consistent with the previously observed tumor susceptibility of Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice .
BPdG , the major DNA adduct associated with tumorigenicity , was the primary DNA adduct formed in esophagus ( a target tissue in the mouse ) , whereas total BP-DNA adducts predominated in higher levels in the liver ( a non-target tissue in the mouse ) .
In an attempt to lower BP-induced DNA damage , we fed the WT and Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice 0.3% chlorophyllin ( CHL ) in the BP-containing diet for 28 days .
The addition of CHL resulted in an increase of BP-DNA adducts in esophagus , liver and lung of WT mice , a lowering of BPdG in esophagi of WT mice and livers of Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice and an increase of BPdG in livers of WT mice .
Therefore , the addition of CHL to a BP-containing diet showed a lack of consistent chemoprotective effect , indicating that oral CHL administration may not reduce PAH-DNA adduct levels consistently in human organs .
