Stannous chloride ( SnCl(2) ) and UVA induce DNA lesions through ROS .
The aim of this work was to study the toxicity induced by UVA preillumination , followed by SnCl(2) treatment .
E. coli BER mutants were used to identify genes which could play a role in DNA lesion repair generated by these agents .
The survival assays showed ( i ) The nfo mutant was the most sensitive to SnCl(2) ; ( ii ) lethal synergistic effect was observed after UVA pre-illumination , plus SnCl(2) incubation , the nfo mutant being the most sensitive ; ( iii ) wild type and nfo mutants , transformed with pBW21 plasmid ( nfo(+) ) had their survival increased following treatments .
The alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis assays pointed that ( i ) UVA induced DNA breaks and fpg mutant was the most sensitive ; ( ii ) SnCl(2)-induced DNA strand breaks were higher than those from UVA and nfo mutant had the slowest repair kinetics ; ( iii ) UVA + SnCl(2) promoted an increase in DNA breaks than SnCl(2) and , again , nfo mutant displayed the slowest repair kinetics .
In summary , Nfo protects E. coli cells against damage induced by SnCl(2) and UVA + SnCl(2) .
