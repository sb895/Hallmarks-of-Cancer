The progression of prostate cancers ( PCs ) to locally invasive , androgen-independent and metastatic disease states is generally associated with treatment resistance and disease relapse .
The present study was undertaken to establish the possibility of using a combination of specific oncogenic products , including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , pAkt , nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-κB ) and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 ( MIC-1 ) as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for optimizing the management of patients with localized PC at earlier disease stages .
The immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence data have revealed that the expression levels of EGFR , Ser(473)-pAkt , NF-κB p65 and MIC-1 proteins were significantly enhanced in the same subset of 76 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma specimens during the disease progression and these biomarkers were expressed in a small subpopulation of CD133(+) PC cells and the bulk tumor mass of CD133(-) PC cells .
Importantly , all of these biomarkers were also overexpressed in 80-100% of 30 PC metastasis bone tissue specimens .
Moreover , the results have indicated that the EGF-EGFR signaling pathway can provide critical functions for the self-renewal of side population ( SP ) cells endowed with stem cell-like features from highly invasive WPE1-NB26 cells .
Of therapeutic interest , the targeting of EGFR , pAkt , NF-κB or MIC-1 was also effective at suppressing the basal and EGF-promoted prostasphere formation by SP WPE1-NB26 cells , inducing disintegration of SP cell-derived prostaspheres and decreasing the viability of SP and non-SP WPE1-NB26 cell fractions .
Also , the targeting of these oncogenic products induced the caspase-dependent apoptosis in chemoresistant SP WPE1-NB26 cells and enhanced their sensibility to the cytotoxic effects induced by docetaxel .
These findings suggest that the combined use of EGFR , pAkt , NF-κB and/or MIC-1 may represent promising strategies for improving the accuracy of current diagnostic and prognostic methods and efficacy of treatments of PC patients in considering the disease heterogeneity , thereby preventing PC progression to metastatic and lethal disease states .
