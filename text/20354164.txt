Mouse models can be useful for increasing the understanding of lung tumorigenesis and assessing the potential of chemopreventive agents .
We explored the role of inflammation in lung tumor development in mice with knockout of the tumor suppressor Gprc5a .
Examination of normal lung tissue and tumors from 51 Gprc5a(+/+) ( adenoma incidence , 9.8% ; adenocarcinoma , 0% ) and 38 Gprc5a(-/-) mice ( adenoma , 63% ; adenocarcinoma , 21% ) revealed macrophage infiltration into lungs of 45% of the Gprc5a(-/-) mice and 8% of Gprc5a(+/+) mice and the direct association of macrophages with 42% of adenomas and 88% of adenocarcinomas in the knockout mice .
Gprc5a(-/-) mouse lungs contained higher constitutive levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and were more sensitive than lungs of Gprc5a(+/+) mice to stimulation of NF-kappaB activation by lipopolysaccharide in vivo .
Studies with epithelial cells cultured from tracheas of Gprc5a(-/-) and Gprc5a(+/+) mice revealed that Gprc5a loss is associated with increased cell proliferation , resistance to cell death in suspension , and increased basal , tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced , and lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB activation , which were reversed partially in Gprc5a(-/-) adenocarcinoma cells by reexpression of Gprc5a .
Compared with Gprc5a(+/+) cells , the Gprc5a(-/-) cells produced higher levels of chemokines and cytokines and their conditioned medium induced more extensive macrophage migration .
Silencing Gprc5a and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB in Gprc5a(+/+) and Gprc5a(-/-) cells , respectively , reversed these effects .
Thus , Gprc5a loss enhances NF-kappaB activation in lung epithelial cells , leading to increased autocrine and paracrine interactions , cell autonomy , and enhanced inflammation , which may synergize in the creation of a tumor-promoting microenvironment .
