PURPOSE Recently , a new renal cell cancer syndrome has been linked to germline mutation of multiple subunits ( SDHB/C/D ) of the Krebs cycle enzyme , succinate dehydrogenase .
We report our experience with the diagnosis , evaluation and treatment of this novel form of hereditary kidney cancer .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with suspected hereditary kidney cancer were enrolled on a National Cancer Institute institutional review board approved protocol to study inherited forms of kidney cancer .
Individuals from families with germline SDHB , SDHC and SDHD mutations , and kidney cancer underwent comprehensive clinical and genetic evaluation .
RESULTS A total of 14 patients from 12 SDHB mutation families were evaluated .
Patients presented with renal cell cancer at an early age ( 33 years , range 15 to 62 ) , metastatic kidney cancer developed in 4 and some families had no manifestation other than kidney tumors .
An additional family with 6 individuals found to have clear cell renal cell cancer that presented at a young average age ( 47 years , range 40 to 53 ) was identified with a germline SDHC mutation ( R133X ) Metastatic disease developed in 2 of these family members .
A patient with a history of carotid body paragangliomas and an aggressive form of kidney cancer was evaluated from a family with a germline SDHD mutation .
CONCLUSIONS SDH mutation associated renal cell carcinoma can be an aggressive type of kidney cancer , especially in younger individuals .
Although detection and management of early tumors is most often associated with a good outcome , based on our initial experience with these patients and our long-term experience with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma , we recommend careful surveillance of patients at risk for SDH mutation associated renal cell carcinoma and wide surgical excision of renal tumors .
