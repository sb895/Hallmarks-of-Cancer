Background .
Over the past ten years oncological outcomes achieved by local excision techniques ( LETs ) as the sole treatment for early stages of rectal cancer ( ESRC ) have been often disappointing .
The reasons for these poor results lie mostly in the high risk of the disease's diffusion to local-regional lymph nodes even in ESRC .
Aims .
This study aims to find the correct indications for LET in ESRC taking into consideration clinical-pathological features of tumours that may reduce the risk of lymph node metastasis to zero .
Methods .
Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of casistics of ESRC treated with total mesorectal excision with the aim of identifying risk factors for nodal involvement .
Results .
The risk of lymph node metastasis is higher in G ≥ 2 and T ≥ 2 tumours with lymphatic and/or vascular invasion .
Other features which have not yet been sufficiently investigated include female gender , TSM stage >1 , presence of tumour budding and/or perineural invasion .
Conclusions .
Results comparable to radical surgery can be achieved by LET only in patients with T(1) N(0) G(1) tumours with low-risk histological features , whereas deeper or more aggressive tumours should be addressed by radical surgery ( RS ) .
