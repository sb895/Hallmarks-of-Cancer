We show that sufficient concentrations of gold nanoparticles produced by an original synthesis method in EMT-6 and CT-26 cancer cells make it possible to detect the presence , necrosis and proliferation of such cells after inoculation in live mice .
We first demonstrated that the nanoparticles do not interfere with the proliferation process .
Then , we observed significant differences in the tumor evolution and the angiogenesis process after shallow and deep inoculation .
A direct comparison with pathology optical images illustrates the effectiveness of this approach .
