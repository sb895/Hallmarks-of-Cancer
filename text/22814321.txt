Muir-Torre syndrome ( MTS ) , a phenotypic variant of the more common hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome , or Lynch syndrome , is an autosomal dominantly inherited condition that combines at least one cutaneous sebaceous neoplasm and at least one visceral malignancy .
Most patients ( with MTS carry mutations in the MSH2 gene ; less than 10% of the cases are associated with a mutation MLH1 gene , and only 3 MTS patients with a pathogenic MSH6 mutation have been previously documented .
We report a family affected with MTS in which 3 members ( father and 2 sons ) were found to harbor a missense mutation c.2633T>C ( p.V878A ) in exon 4 of the MSH6 gene .
