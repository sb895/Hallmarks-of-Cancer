Necrotic cells are known to activate the innate immune system and trigger inflammation by releasing damage associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) .
However , how necrotic cells influence the induction of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses under sterile conditions , in the absence of pathogen associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) , remains poorly understood .
Here , we examined antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to primary sterile necrotic tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo .
We found that primary necrotic cells alone fail to generate CD8(+) T cell-dependent immune responses toward cell-associated antigens .
We show that necrotic cells trigger CD8(+) T-cell immunity only in the presence of PAMPs or analogs , such as p(dI-dC) and/or unmethylated CpG DNA .
The electroporation of tumor cells with these PAMPs prior to necrosis induction triggered antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses through a TLR9/MyD88-dependent pathway .
In addition , we found that necrotic cells contain factors that can block the cross-priming of CD8(+) T cells even under non-sterile conditions and can serve as a possible mechanism of immunosuppression .
These results suggest that antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to primary necrotic tumor cells can be induced in the presence of PAMPs and thus have a substantial impact on the development of antitumor vaccination strategies .
