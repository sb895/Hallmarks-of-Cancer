A panel of primary human cells and virus-transformed derivatives were tested for events that coincide with immortalization .
In all primary and precrisis cells , two proteins of 92 and 150 kDa that shared an epitope with p53 were found ; in most of their immortalized derivatives , however , they were absent .
Expression of these proteins may be involved in senescence .
