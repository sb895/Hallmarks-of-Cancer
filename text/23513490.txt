Metastases in the sellar region are rare and are frequently found incidentally or in necropsies .
Only 7% are reported to be symptomatic .
Diabetes insipidus , anterior pituitary dysfunction , visual field defects , headache/pain and ophthalmoplegia are the most commonly reported symptoms .
We present the cases of two male patients with a small-cell lung carcinoma whose first clinical symptoms were due to pituitary metastasis .
One case presented with symptoms of cavernous sinus invasion and panhypopituitarism and the other case with diabetes insipidus .
Both patients had a rapid progression of their disease despite chemotherapy and died after a few months .
Pituitary metastases occur most commonly with breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men .
The presence of polyuria and polydipsia in an oncologic patient should alert the physician for diabetes insipidus and , if confirmed , an imaging procedure of the pituitary gland is mandatory .
Treatment for these tumors is often multimodal and includes surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone replacement .
Although surgical series have not shown any significant survival benefits given by tumor resection , the patient's quality of life may be improved .
