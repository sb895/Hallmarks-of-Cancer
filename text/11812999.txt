Primary fibroblasts respond to activated H-RAS(V12) by undergoing premature arrest , which resembles replicative senescence .
This irreversible ' fail-safe mechanism ' requires p19(ARF) , p53 and the Retinoblastoma ( Rb ) family : upon their disruption , RAS(V12)-expressing cells fail to undergo senescence and continue to proliferate .
Similarly , co-expression of oncogenes such as c-MYC or E1A rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence .
To identify novel genes that allow escape from RAS(V12)-induced senescence , we designed an unbiased , retroviral complementary DNA library screen .
We report on the identification of DRIL1 , the human orthologue of the mouse Bright and Drosophila dead ringer transcriptional regulators .
DRIL1 renders primary murine fibroblasts unresponsive to RAS(V12)-induced anti-proliferative signalling by p19(ARF)/p53/p21(CIP1) , as well as by p16(INK4a) .
In this way , DRIL1 not only rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence but also causes these fibroblasts to become highly oncogenic .
Furthermore , DRIL1 immortalizes mouse fibroblasts , in the presence of high levels of p16(INK4a) .
Immortalization by DRIL1 , whose product binds the pRB-controlled transcription factor E2F1 ( ref. 8 ) , is correlated with induction of E2F1 activity .
Correspondingly , DRIL1 induces the E2F1 target Cyclin E1 , overexpression of which is sufficient to trigger escape from senescence .
Thus , DRIL1 disrupts cellular protection against RAS(V12)-induced proliferation downstream of the p19(ARF)/p53 pathway .
