BACKGROUND In this paper we propose a chemical physics mechanism for the initiation of the glycolytic switch commonly known as the Warburg hypothesis , whereby glycolytic activity terminating in lactate continues even in well-oxygenated cells .
We show that this may result in cancer via mitotic failure , recasting the current conception of the Warburg effect as a metabolic dysregulation consequent to cancer , to a biophysical defect that may contribute to cancer initiation .
MODEL Our model is based on analogs of thermodynamic concepts that tie non-equilibrium fluid dynamics ultimately to metabolic imbalance , disrupted microtubule dynamics , and finally , genomic instability , from which cancers can arise .
Specifically , we discuss how an analog of non-equilibrium Rayleigh-Benard convection can result in glycolytic oscillations and cause a cell to become locked into a higher-entropy state characteristic of cancer .
CONCLUSIONS A quantitative model is presented that attributes the well-known Warburg effect to a biophysical mechanism driven by a convective disturbance in the cell .
Contrary to current understanding , this effect may precipitate cancer development , rather than follow from it , providing new insights into carcinogenesis , cancer treatment , and prevention .
