Many molecular mechanisms contribute to the development of doxorubicin resistance and different cancers can express wide and diverse arrays of drug-resistance genes .
The aim of this study was to identify the changes in gene expression associated with the development of doxorubicin resistance in MCF7 breast cancer cell line .
The doxorubicin resistant MCF7 cell line was developed by stepwise selection of MCF7 cells and was tested using the MTT assay .
The alterations in gene expression were examined using the real-time based PCR array .
The findings showed an up-regulation of many phase I/II metabolizing genes , specifically , the CYP1A1 and the CYP1A2 that were up-regulated by 206- and 96-fold respectively .
Drug efflux pump genes were also up-regulated profoundly .
TOP2A was strongly down-regulated by 202-fold .
Many other changes were observed in genes crucial for cell cycle , apoptosis and DNA repair .
The findings of this project imply that the development of doxorubicin resistance is a multi-factorial process .
