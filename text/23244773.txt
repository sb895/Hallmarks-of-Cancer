ABSTRACT : PurposeAutophagy has attracted attentions as a novel mechanism for tumor development .
In this study Human ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3 and multidrug-resistant phenotype SKVCR cells were used and the roles of autophagy in radiation-induced cell death were analyzed.Methods and materialsCell viability was examined by colony formation and cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay , 3MA and ZVAD were used to block autophagy and apoptosis , respectively .
Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA level and Western blot was used to detect protein expression , monodansylcadaverine ( MDC ) staining and flow cytometery were used for autophagy , apoptosis and cell cycle dynamics , respectively .
RESULTS : ( 1 ) The radiosensitivity exhibited differently in SKOV3 and SKVCR cells ( SKOV3 : D0=3.37 , SKVCR : D0= 4.18 ) ; compared with SKOV3 the constitutive expression of MAPLC3 in SKVCR was higher , but no change of Caspase-3 and cleaved Caspase-3 .
( 2 ) The ionizing radiation ( IR)- induced apoptosis and autophagy were significant in both cells ( P<0.05 ) ; inhibition of apoptosis with ZVAD showed no impact on survival of SKOV3 and SKVCR cells after radiation , while inhibition of autophagy significantly decreased viability in SKVCR cells , for SKVO3 cells only low level of radiation ( 2 Gy and 4 Gy ) could decrease the viability(P<0.05) .
( 3 ) ZVAD inhibited apoptosis and autophagy in both cells , 3MA inhibit apoptosis in SKOV3 , and promote apoptosis in SKVCR , together with inhibition of autophagy .
( 4 ) G2/M arrest was induced by radiation in both cells ; the accumulation of G2/M was more significant in SKOV3 , 3MA attenuated the radiation-induced S phase delay in SKVCR .
CONCLUSION : IR-induced autophagy provides a self-protective mechanism against radiotherapy in SKVCR cells , the use of autophagy inhibitor , 3MA , increases the killing effects of radiation by inhibiting autophagy and radiation- induced S phase delay , also by the increase of apoptosis , which suggests a better therapeutic strategy in drug- resistant SKVCR ovarian cancer cells .
