Chemoprevention is one feasible approach to decreasing morbidity and mortality of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .
The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms of chemoprevention of NSCLC by Prunella vulgaris L .
( PV ) using a PV extract of 60% ethanol ( P-60 ) .
In an A/J mouse model benzo[a]pyrene induction of lung tumors was significantly reduced difference by P-60 group .
In addition , P-60 was found to have the ability to regulate cell cycle and induce apoptosis in SPC-A-1 cells .
Therefore , we propose that P-60 has potential as a lung cancer chemopreventive agent .
