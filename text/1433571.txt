At present , isoniazid ( INH ) is being used prophylactically to reduce the side effects of intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder cancer , although it is not clear whether or not this reduces the antitumor efficacy of BCG .
In this study the impact of INH treatment on the immune response after repeated intravesical BCG administration was investigated in guinea pigs .
INH was given on the 3 days around each BCG instillation .
We found that the administration of INH severely impaired the immunological effects of BCG .
The induction of mononuclear cell infiltration in the bladder wall was reduced .
Enlargement of the regional lymph nodes ( weight and number of cells ) , and increase of MHC Class II expression on the lymph node cells , normally observed after intravesical BCG administration , were inhibited by INH .
Systemic immunity , measured by the DTH reaction in the skin to PPD , was also diminished due to the combined treatment of BCG with INH .
When INH was administered during the last 4 of 6 BCG instillations , the immune response to BCG was still impaired .
A five-fold increase of the dose of BCG did not overcome the effect of INH .
INH probably did not exert a direct suppression of the immune system of the guinea pig as the DNCB skin reactivity was not influenced .
Although INH concentrations in the urine were high at the onset of the instillation , in vitro experiments indicated that the effect of INH may not be caused by killing of the BCG organisms shortly after application in the bladder .
In conclusion , our data in guinea pigs suggest that the use of INH may impair the immune response to intravesical BCG .
As this response may be important for the antitumor effect of BCG , urologists should be cautious with the prophylactic use of INH .
The influence on the antitumor efficacy is now investigated in man .
