Medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lucidum is one of the most esteemed natural products that have been used in the traditional Chinese medicine .
In this article , we demonstrate that G. lucidum triterpene extract ( GLT ) suppresses proliferation of human colon cancer cells HT-29 and inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model of colon cancer .
These effects of GLT are associated with the cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and the induction of the programmed cell death Type II-autophagy in colon cancer cells .
Here , we show that GLT induces formation of autophagic vacuoles and upregulates expression of Beclin-1 ( 1.3-fold increase ) and LC-3 ( 7.3-fold increase ) proteins in colon cancer cells and in tumors in a xenograft model ( Beclin-1 , 3.9-fold increase ; LC-3 , 1.9-fold increase ) .
Autophagy is mediated through the inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38 MAPK ) because p38 MAPK inhibitor , SB202190 , induces autophagy and expression of Beclin-1 ( 1.2-fold increase ) and LC-3 ( 7.4-fold increase ) , and GLT suppresses phosphorylation of p38 MAPK ( approximately 60% inhibition ) in colon cancer cells .
Taken together , our data demonstrate a novel mechanism responsible for the inhibition of colon cancer cells by G. lucidum and suggest GLT as natural product for the treatment of colon cancer .
